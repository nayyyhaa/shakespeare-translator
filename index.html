        <h1>Shakespeare Translator</h1>
        <h3>Shakespeare invented many words and his style of narration in many ways was unique to his time. His ever popular works ( dramas and poems ) makes his language style live even today. I've always  been curious about how Shakespeare would've expressed my thoughts in his words.
            Have you been too??
        </h3>
        <h2>Then you've come to the right place my friend!</h2>
        <p>This translator takes English as input and converts to Shakespeare English.</p>
